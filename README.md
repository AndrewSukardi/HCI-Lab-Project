# HCI-Lab-Project

I am developing and creating the website SpaceTD from scratch as a reference to SpaceX for my university's Human-Computer Interaction lab project. This website encompasses several features, including responsive design to cater to various screen sizes from phones to desktops, form validation, animations, and a wide range of other functionalities.
